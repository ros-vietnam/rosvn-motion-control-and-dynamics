# ROS Vietnam – Motion Control, Dynamics & Actuation  
`rosvn-motion-control-and-dynamics`

> **A research-grade repository for robot motion control, system dynamics, and actuation algorithms in ROS 2.**

---

## 1. Overview

**ROS Vietnam Motion Control, Dynamics & Actuation** is the official control-focused repository of the **ROS Vietnam** community.

This repository addresses the **lowest and most critical layer of robotics autonomy**:
- Motion control
- Robot dynamics
- Actuation modeling
- Control stability and robustness

The repository is **simulation-first**, hardware-agnostic, and academically rigorous.

## 2. Why This Repository Matters

Many robotics projects fail not because of perception or planning,
but because of **poor control and unmodeled dynamics**.

This repository exists to:
- Bridge control theory and real-world robotics
- Promote physically-consistent modeling
- Enable reproducible control experiments
- Educate contributors in *correct* robotics engineering

> *Autonomy collapses without stable control.*
